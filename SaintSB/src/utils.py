        'To escape a crocodiles jaw, push your thumb into its eyeballs.',
        'Cats have only lived with people for about 7,000 years. Compared to dogs, whose domestication may have begun as early as 25,000 years ago.',
        'Most of the Earth‚Äôs longest-surviving species are found in the ocean. While cyanobacterias are technically the oldest living organisms on Earth, having appeared 2.8 billion years ago, the ocean sponge has also been on Earth for 580 million years, and jellyfish have been here for 550 million years.',

        'Additionally, up to 73 million sharks per year die due to shark finning, where fishermen catch the shark, cut off its fins, and throw the still-living shark back into the water.

A few countries, notably Israel, Egypt, Ecuador, Honduras, Brunei and the Maldives, have total shark fishing bans.',

        'Dog noses are as unique as a human fingerprint.',
        'Paul Revere famously yelled ‚ÄúThe British Are Coming!‚Äô at the start of the American Revolution. Or...not.

A lot of colonial Americans still considered themselves British at that time, and would have likely been confused if he‚Äôd actually said or shouted this.',
        'Many people came forward pretending to be Grand Duchess Anastasia after the Czar fell in the Russian Revolution. But Anastasia impersonators came from a long tradition of royal imposters; Louis XVII of France died during the French Revolution, and years later when the country was discussing a revival of the monarchy, over 100 people came forward claiming to be the prince.',

        'Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin were all nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. While not all nominees since have been controversy-free, whoever nominated these three probably regretted it.',
        'We know now that the bubonic plague was in part spread by rats. But before the plague, Pope Gregory IX declared that cats were associated with devil worship and ordered that they be exterminated. Unfortunately, people listened and as a result the rat population flourished. It is believed that the increased rat population contributed to the plague. (Ahem, actions have consequences, and don‚Äôt mess with cats)',
        'Jeanette Rankin was the first woman elected to Congress in 1916, 4 years before women had the right to vote. She was a pacifist from Montana, and was elected a second time in 1941. Both times, she voted no in regards to entering World Wars 1 and 2.',

        'The Great Barrier Reef is the largest living structure on Earth at 2,000 kilometers long.',

        'When helium is cooled to absolute zero (-460 degrees Fahrenheit) it becomes a liquid and starts flowing upward, against gravity.',
        'The moon once had an atmosphere. Volcanic eruptions on the moon released trillions of tons of gas into the air, which created an atmosphere. The gases eventually became lost to space.',
        'When Einstein posed his Theory of Relativity, he didn‚Äôt have the resources to prove this theory. However, the theory has been proven correct several times over the years. Most recently in 2018, scientists saw that as a black hole distorted light waves from a nearby star in a way that agrees with the theory.',
        'Scientists have answered the question ‚Äúwhat comes first the chicken or the egg?‚Äù The chicken came first because the egg shell contains a protein that can only be made from a hen.',
